Task Description:
Each year new technologies emerge that offer promise for organisations if they adopt them. However, it is not easy to predict what is going to be successful, or provide competitive advantages, over the hype that these emerging technologies can create. Every year Gartner provides a graphical representation of emerging technologies based on their maturity, adoption, and social application. The 2018 hype cycle is presented in Figure 1, which provides organisations with a graphical representation of the maturity and adoption of technologies and applications, and how they are potentially relevant to solving real business problems and exploiting new opportunities. Gartner also provides an explanation of how to understand the hype cycles.

As is evident in Figure 1, the emerging technologies are at different levels of maturity and adoption, which organisations need to be able to understand, and how they can impact their way of doing business. For this part of the assignment, your task is to select an emerging technology from Gartner’s 2017 list and write a short report for venture capitalists on your choice. Your report should address dissemination, acceptance, and commercial success of the technology, both the drivers and inhibitors, and conclude with your overall assessment of the prospects for the technology. Your report (~750 words) should be posted to the",1,1,2018-10-22 10:38:32.830789,2018-10-22 10:38:32.830789,blasting it today

Task Objective: Demonstrate your understanding of internet technologies and HTML.
Task Description:
You are a consultant for a major firm and have been hired into a bricks and mortar chain that want to build an e-commerce presence to sell their products and services online. Your project team has been tasked with specifying a new environment for your organisation’s entry into e-commerce. The team will eventually have to specify, design, build and implement the complete environment. In the early discussions around specifications, a number of the other team members have asked about network technologies and in particular the OSI model and how it relates to what the team are trying to do. This task is divided into two parts:
